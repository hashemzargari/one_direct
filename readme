1- you need psql db -> "name: one_direct"
2-1 redis cache and config it
2-2 migrate db
2-3 createsuperuser
3- run celery worker -> " celery -A one_direct worker -l info "
4- use documents -> you can access to docs -> "127.0.0.1:8000/doc or 127.0.0.1:8000/redoc"


NOTE: I had little time and the user and analytics sections were not written clean or is incomplete.
Also, to improve the work, the main structure of Redis(cache) can be changed.
